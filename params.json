On Ubuntu, try:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nsudo apt-get update\r\nsudo apt-get install curl\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you just want to experiment with running PTero, then simply run:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n./ptero init\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you want to get started developing PTero, then you should also fork all the\r\nsubmodule repositories and specify your [GitHub](https://github.com/) username\r\nbefore running:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n./ptero init -u <username>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will clone all needed submodules and setup remotes for your forks of those\r\nrepos.  It will not directly fork those repos on github.\r\n\r\n## Running PTero on Vagrant\r\nBefore running PTero on Vagrant, you must make sure Vagrant 1.6 or newer is\r\ninstalled on your machine.  To setup Vagrant to run PTero, including the\r\ninstallation of required Vagrant plugins, run this:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n./ptero deploy vagrant init\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnce Vagrant has been initialized for PTero, run PTero on Vagrant by running\r\nthis:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n./ptero deploy vagrant create\r\n```\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
